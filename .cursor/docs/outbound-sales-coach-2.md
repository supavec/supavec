Below is a punch-list of improvements, grouped by Conversion, Copy & Content, Visual / UX, and Technical / SEO.  Skim the headers first, then cherry-pick the items that resonate.

1. Conversion Boosters (highest impact)

Area	Issue	Suggested Fix
Above-the-fold trust	No immediate proof that agencies already use Supavec	Add a slim “Trusted by” bar (3–5 small logos or first-name/agency badges) directly under the CTAs.
Primary CTA clarity	Two CTAs (“3-min demo” and “Run my transcript”) feel equal weight ⇒ choice paralysis	a) Make one the primary (high-contrast button) and the other a ghost link.b) Label with an outcome: “Get 3-min Demo” → “Watch 3-min Demo” / “Run Free Transcript” → “Generate My Free Brief”.
Micro-conversion	No email capture for lukewarm visitors	Between Pain↔Promise and 3-Step Process, embed a light “ROI Calculator” form (email + avg. calls per week) → instant savings estimate.
Social proof depth	Testimonials are generic	Swap placeholders for short, numbers-anchored quotes (“Supavec cut review time from 40 min to 8 min per call” – Sarah, RevOps Lead @ XYZ). Faces > logos > text-only.
Pricing scent	Zero hint of cost	Even a “Starts at $XX / 100 calls” anchor price filters tire kickers and stops hidden-price anxiety.

2. Copy & Content Tweaks

Section	Observation	Improvement
Headline	Strong, but could speak to agency persona	“Turn Every Client Call Into a Playbook-Ready Brief—Automatically.”
Sub-headline	Mentions Zoom & Fireflies, nice. Missing the open-source/privacy hook	Append: “All powered by our open-source RAG engine—deploy in your own VPC or use ours.”
Pain column	Bullets use full sentences; skimmability suffers	Convert to “emoji/ icon + 4-6 words” (e.g., 📉 “Manager binge-watching replays” ).
Promise column	Copy OK, lacks specificity	Add 1 data point: “One-page summary in < 30 sec.”
Result cards	Placeholder metrics (24 s / 95 % / 3×) look random	Back them with footnote (+link) to a short methodology blog or pilot data.
Founding Partner Program	Nice, but buried	Pull it up right after “Trusted by leaders” as a solution for FOMO: “Only 9 spots left”.
FAQ	Good spread; add one on white-label / client branding—agencies will ask.

3. Visual / UX Polish
	1.	Hero visual – Consider a subtle auto-play toggle: 3-second loop that flicks between the raw transcript and the color-coded brief, reinforcing “before → after” without requiring scroll.
	2.	3-Step icons – Use sequential numbering circles (1-2-3) to guide the eye; current icons are colored but not ordered.
	3.	Integrations bar – Add a “Coming soon” pill on logos in roadmap to set expectations (e.g., Gong, Chorus).
	4.	Section dividers – The faint grey lines work, but alternating very light grey / white section backgrounds improves scannability.
	5.	Sticky nav CTA – On scroll, morph the nav bar into a slim strip with a single “Get Demo” button to catch exit intent.

4. Technical & SEO

Item	Why it matters	Quick Win
Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)	Above-the-fold hero image may be >150 kB	Convert to WebP & lazy-load anything below the fold.
Schema markup	FAQ & How-To schema boosts SERP visibility	Add FAQPage & SoftwareApplication structured data.
Alt & aria labels	Accessibility & SEO	Provide descriptive alt tags for the transcript/brief image (“Screenshot showing call transcript converted into coaching brief”).
Meta title / description	Not shown in screenshot	Use primary keyword: “AI Sales Call Coaching for Agencies – Supavec”.
Viewport animations	If using heavy JS for counters/accordion, throttle or use CSS-only where possible.

5. Extras to Consider (road-map, not must-do today)
	•	Interactive sandbox – Let visitors paste 2–3 sentences and see a mini-brief inline. The dopamine hit drives sign-ups.
	•	ROI white-paper – “How a 15-seat agency regained 12 hrs/week with AI-powered call briefs” (PDF lead magnet).
	•	RevOps playbook template – Free Notion or Google Doc; exchange email → pipeline fuel.
	•	Video testimonial – 45-second Loom from a pilot manager beats paragraphs of text.

⸻

TL;DR (if you only tackle three things)
	1.	Add instant credibility at the very top (logos, single primary CTA, pilot numbers).
	2.	Inject real data (processing speed, time saved) and reference source.
	3.	Create a micro-interactive moment (ROI calc or brief generator) to move visitors from passive scroll to active lead.

Knock those out, and the page will feel sharper, more trustworthy, and laser-aligned with B2B sales agencies’ buying triggers.
